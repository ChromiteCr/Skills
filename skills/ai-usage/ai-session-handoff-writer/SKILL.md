description: 当一个长任务要跨 session 继续、或者要交给另一个人、另一个 Agent 接手时使用。把当前进度压成一份可移植的交接文档：目标、已确认完成的事、关键决定及其理由、证据与验证状态、遗留风险、下一步的具体动作、重启须知。事实与推断分开标注，没验证过的绝不写成已完成。写的是跨 session 的交接，不是子代理交回主代理的那种短单。

# ai-session-handoff-writer

## What this skill does

This skill turns an in-progress task into a handoff document that another agent or person can continue with minimal context loss.

It is optimized for long-running work, session resets, model switches, ownership changes, and paused tasks.

## Use this skill when

- A task will continue in another session
- Work is being transferred between people or agents
- A project has multiple open threads and needs a clean restart point
- You need to preserve not just status, but also why decisions were made

## Do not use this skill when

- A one-line chat update is enough
- There is no meaningful progress, decision, or artifact to hand off
- The recipient is not allowed to see the underlying work or data
- The main need is a code diff review rather than a task-level handoff

## Required inputs

Collect or infer these before writing:

1. **Task objective** — what the work is trying to achieve
2. **Current state** — what is already done and what remains open
3. **Artifacts** — files, documents, links, tickets, datasets, or outputs that matter
4. **Key decisions** — important choices already made
5. **Rationale** — why those choices were made
6. **Verification status** — what has been checked versus assumed
7. **Risks or blockers** — what could stop or mislead the next worker
8. **Next step** — the best immediate continuation action

If any required input is missing, keep the section and label it clearly as `[missing]` rather than inventing details.

## Evidence labels

Use these labels consistently inside the handoff:

- `[confirmed]` — directly verified from files, tests, outputs, or trusted records
- `[inferred]` — strongly supported but not directly verified in the current context
- `[unverified]` — reported, assumed, or still needs checking
- `[missing]` — required information is not currently available

Do not blur these categories.

## Workflow

### 1) Define the handoff target

State who or what should be able to continue after reading the handoff:

- another general-purpose agent
- a coding-focused agent
- a human collaborator
- your future self in a later session

Write for the least-informed plausible recipient.

### 2) Separate facts from interpretation

Before drafting, sort notes into:

- completed work
- decisions
- evidence
- open questions
- next actions

If a claim cannot be supported, mark it `[inferred]` or `[unverified]`.

### 3) Capture only the continuation-critical context

Prefer information that changes what the next worker should do:

- exact file paths or artifact names
- commands already tried and their outcomes
- constraints, approvals, or boundaries
- rejected approaches worth not repeating
- ordering dependencies

Avoid dumping long transcripts unless they contain irreplaceable reasoning.

### 4) Write the handoff in the standard structure

Use the template in `handoff-template.md`.

Minimum required sections:

1. Objective
2. Current status
3. Completed work
4. Key decisions and rationale
5. Evidence and verification
6. Outstanding issues and risks
7. Recommended next actions
8. Restart notes

### 5) Validate before sending

A handoff is only complete if the next worker can answer all of these:

- What is the goal?
- What is already done?
- What should not be undone lightly?
- What still needs verification?
- What is the very next action?
- Where are the relevant artifacts?

If any answer is unclear, revise the handoff.

## Output rules

- Prefer bullets over long prose
- Put the next action near the end as a numbered list
- Name files and paths explicitly
- Preserve uncertainty labels
- Keep tone neutral and operational
- Redact secrets, tokens, passwords, and private data unless explicitly authorized for the recipient

## Quality checklist

Before finalizing, confirm:

- All required sections are present
- Every major claim has an evidence label
- Paths, URLs, or artifact identifiers are explicit where relevant
- Decisions include reasons, not just outcomes
- Risks mention likely failure modes or missing information
- Next actions are ordered and concrete
- The document does not expose secrets beyond the intended audience

## Failure modes to avoid

- Writing a status summary with no restart path
- Mixing verified facts with guesses
- Omitting the rationale behind important choices
- Burying blockers in narrative text
- Providing ten possible next steps instead of one recommended sequence
- Repeating raw chat history instead of distilling it

## Handoff compression guidance

When the context is large, compress in this order:

1. Keep decisions and rationale
2. Keep artifact locations
3. Keep verification results
4. Keep blockers and dependencies
5. Summarize routine background detail last

## Suggested prompt pattern

When using this skill, produce a handoff document that:

- preserves verified progress
- distinguishes confirmed vs inferred vs unverified information
- lists concrete artifacts and locations
- explains key decisions and why they were made
- ends with a short ordered next-step plan

## Deliverable

Return a completed handoff document based on this skill's own `handoff-template.md`.

### Not the same as the repository's short handoff

`templates/handoff-template.md` at the repository root is a **different artifact**: a ~30-line
note from a sub-agent back to its parent, inside one session, carrying only the result, the
evidence location and the next step. It assumes the reader already has the context.

This skill writes the **cross-session** handoff, where the next reader has no context at all,
so it additionally carries decisions with their rationale, what was already tried and should not
be repeated, and restart notes.

Pick by one question: **does whoever picks this up already have this session's context?**
Yes → use the repository's short template. No → use this one.
